     <h2>The nature and functions of law</h2>
        <p>it is customary to preface a discussion about law with one or two broad generalizations about the nature of human beings      
           . yet it is sometimes said that one cannot or should not generalize. this is patent nonsense. one can generalize but the
            generalization must be supported by evidence, and the danger arises in generalizing beyong the particular evidence available.</p>

     <h2><i>TRUISMS</i> ABOUT HUMAN NATURE</h2>
       <p>professor <acronym>H.L.A</acronym> Hart in his book, <i>The Concept Of Law</i>, put forward certain generalizations about mankind
          which he says are <i>truisms</i>, and which, given survival as an aim, afford a reason (or more precisely a set of reasons) why
          morality and law endure and possess a specific content. The facts are
         <ol>
           <ul>
              <li>human vulnerability</li>
              <li>approximate equality</li>
              <li>limited altruism</li>
              <li>limited resources and</li>
              <li>limited understanding and strenght of will</li>
          </ul>
          </ol>
